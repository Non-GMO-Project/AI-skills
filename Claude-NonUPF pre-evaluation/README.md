Navigate to Settings → Capabilities. Ensure that Code execution and file creation is enabled. Claude Skills won't work without this on.

Still in Settings → Capabilities, scroll down to the Skills section. Click "Upload skill" and upload a ZIP file containing your skill folder. 

Just uploading doesn't activate it. You need to toggle it ON. Find your skill in the list and flip the switch to the ON position.
