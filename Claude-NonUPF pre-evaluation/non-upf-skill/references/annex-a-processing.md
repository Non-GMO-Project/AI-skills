# Annex A — Classification of Food Processing Methods

Source: Non-UPF Standard v1.0, Annex A (Normative)

## Classification Summary

| Classification | Threshold | Effect on Product |
|---|---|---|
| Prohibited | Never allowed, anywhere | Immediate disqualifier |
| Conditional | ≤30% of ingredients by adjusted weight | Allowed if threshold met |
| Permissible — Minimal | No limit | Allowed freely |
| Permissible — Moderate | No limit | Allowed freely |

**Adjusted weight % = ingredient weight ÷ (total product weight − added water − added salt) × 100**

## PROHIBITED METHODS
*Cannot be used at any stage — ingredient production or finished product.*

**Biological:**
- Precision Fermentation (synthetic biology)
- Biomass Fermentation
- Enzymatic Interesterification

**Chemical:**
- Hydrogenation (full or partial)
- Chemical Interesterification
- Enzymatic Synthesis (cross-linking, transglucosylation, glycosylation, isomerization)
- Decolorization using synthetic ion exchange resin with engineered polymers or nanomaterials
- Hazardous VOC-based extraction methods

**Mechanical:**
- 3D Printing

**Other:**
- Nanotechnology

## CONDITIONAL METHODS
*May be used if total conditionally processed ingredients ≤30% of product (adjusted weight).*

**Biological:**
- Industrial fermentation (for highly modified ingredients — e.g., xanthan gum, citric acid)

**Chemical:**
- Enzymatic, Acid, or Alkali Hydrolysis
- High temperature refining of oils (≥200°C) — e.g., RBD oils
- Bleaching (chemical absorbents) for oil refining
- Deodorizing (high heat vacuum steam distillation) for oil refining
- Carbonatation (lime and CO₂ clarification) — used in sugar refining
- Phosphatation (lime and phosphoric acid clarification) — used in sugar refining
- Decolorization using bone char or activated carbon
- Decolorization/purification using ion exchange resin
- Recrystallization of isolated sugars

**Mechanical:**
- Agglomeration of powders for increased dispersibility

**Thermal:**
- High heat extrusion (≥200°F / 93°C)
- Flavor extraction using distillation
- Spray drying
- Deep frying (when it is the sole cooking step)

---

## PERMISSIBLE METHODS — MINIMAL
*No usage limit. Preserves natural structure.*

- Cutting
- Peeling
- Washing
- Freezing
- Winterization of oils

---

## PERMISSIBLE METHODS — MODERATE
*No usage limit. Maintains fundamental food characteristics.*

**Biological:**
- Traditional fermentation (e.g., sourdough, yogurt cultures, kimchi, vinegar)

**Chemical:**
- Ethanol extraction
- Supercritical CO₂ extraction
- Curing
- Smoking

**Mechanical:**
- High moisture extrusion and forming
- Mechanical pressing
- Homogenization
- High Pressure Processing (HPP)
- Microfiltration / ultrafiltration (membrane-based)
- Centrifugal separation
- Milling / grinding
- Cold press or expeller press

**Thermal:**
- Baking
- Dehydration
- Drying
- Pasteurization (UP, UHT)
- Ultra High Heat Treatment (indirect steam)
- Roasting, cooking, grilling, braising
- Canning / pressure cooking
- Pressure assisted thermal treatment
- Infrared heating
- Deep frying (when another cooking step is also included)
- Freeze drying

## Common Classification Questions

**Is spray drying allowed?**
Conditional. Products made via spray drying (e.g., powdered milk, instant coffee) count toward the 30% conditional limit.

**Is traditional fermentation (sourdough, yogurt, cheese, vinegar, miso) allowed?**
Yes — permissible, moderate. This is distinct from industrial fermentation.

**Is cold-pressed oil allowed?**
Yes — permissible, moderate. Expeller press and cold press are both permissible.

**Is RBD (refined, bleached, deodorized) oil allowed?**
Conditional. The refining steps are conditional processing, so RBD oils count toward the 30% limit and must collectively stay ≤30% of the product.

**Is solvent-extracted oil (e.g., hexane-extracted soy oil) allowed?**
No — both solvent extraction and the resulting oil (listed in Annex B) are prohibited.

**Is high-heat extrusion (e.g., puffed cereals, extruded snacks) allowed?**
Conditional if ≥200°F. Below that temperature it's permissible moderate.

**Are citric acid, lactic acid allowed?**
Citric acid produced via industrial fermentation is conditional. Lactic acid from traditional fermentation is permissible. Ask the supplier.

**Is refined cane sugar (white sugar) allowed?**
The refining process (carbonatation/phosphatation, bleaching, recrystallization) is conditional — so white sugar counts as a conditionally processed ingredient. Products using it must meet the added sugar limits of Section 6.3.2.

**Is honey, maple syrup, date sugar allowed?**
Generally yes if minimally processed. Products sweetened only with these are exempt from added sugar limits.
