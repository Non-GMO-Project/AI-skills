# Added Sugar Limits by Product Type

Source: Non-UPF Standard v1.0, Section 6.3.2, Table 6-1

## When Do Limits Apply?

Only when the product contains sweeteners that are the result of **conditional processing** (e.g., refined cane sugar, corn syrup, brown rice syrup, agave syrup, concentrated fruit juice used as sweetener).

**Exempt products:**
- No sweeteners at all
- Sweeteners obtained only through permissible processing (honey, maple syrup, date paste, unrefined whole fruit)

## Limits Table

| Product Type | Maximum Added Sugar by Weight |
|---|---|
| Confectionery (candy, chocolate) | 40% |
| Creamers — dairy or non-dairy (serving size ≤2 tbsp) | 25% |
| Desserts (cookies, ice cream, bars, cakes, pastries, popsicles) | 20% |
| Breakfast Foods (cereal, granola, instant oatmeal, french toast, crêpes) | 15% |
| Dairy & Dairy Alternatives (yogurt, milk, cream cheese) | 7% |
| Breads, Tortillas, Buns, Bagels | 5% |
| Beverages (juice, coffee, tea, soda, kombucha) | 5% |
| Nut Butters & Spreads | 5% |
| Protein Powders (whey, pea protein, collagen) | 5% |
| Condiments (ketchup, dressing, mayonnaise) | 3% |
| Prepared Meals (frozen or shelf-stable) | 3% |
| Soups & Savory Sauces (tomato sauce, broth) | 2% |
| Snack Foods (chips, crackers, popcorn) | 2% |
| Meat & Plant-Based Protein (jerky, sausage, deli meat) | 2% |
| Baby & Toddler Foods (marketed to children <4 years) | 2% |
| Dry Mixes (baking mixes, dried soups, ready-to-mix beverages) | Variable — calculate as prepared |

## Calculation

```
Added Sugar % = (grams of added sugars per serving ÷ serving size in grams) × 100
```

**Important:** This uses total weight (including water and salt) — NOT adjusted weight. This is different from the processing threshold calculation.

**When to use unrounded values** (Section 6.3.2.5):
- Always when the limit is 5% or lower
- When the calculated result using rounded label values is within 0.5% of the limit
- To confirm compliance in close cases

## Dry Mix Products (Section 6.3.2.7)

Calculate based on the **prepared** product following manufacturer's directions, not the dry mix alone.

Example: Pancake mix where 1/3 cup dry mix (40g) + egg + milk = 120g prepared serving
- Added sugar in dry mix: 6g
- Added sugar %: 6g ÷ 120g × 100 = 5%
- Product type: Breakfast Foods (15% limit) → PASS

## Classification Guidance

When a product could fit multiple categories, use good faith judgment and document the rationale. Lean toward the more restrictive category when genuinely ambiguous. Factors to consider:
- Primary consumer use occasion
- Format and format conventions
- Marketing and positioning
- Regulatory labeling category

Example: A high-protein chocolate bar could be "Confectionery" (40%) or "Protein Powders" (5%). If it's sold in the candy aisle and consumed like a treat, classify as confectionery. If sold in supplement stores as a protein supplement, consider protein powders. Document the reasoning.
