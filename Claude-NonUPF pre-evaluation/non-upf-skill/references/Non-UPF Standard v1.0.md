# Foreword {#foreword}

Ultraprocessed foods (UPFs) have been the focus of growing scientific research and public concern, with a wide and rapidly expanding body of research linking them to a range of adverse health outcomes, including obesity, metabolic disorders, heart disease, cancer, cognitive decline, anxiety, and depression. But what defines a UPF isn’t just what’s in it, it’s how it’s made: the degree of industrial processing, the use of engineered additives, and formulation strategies designed to override natural satiety signals, drive addiction, and distort the structure of real food.

**The Non-UPF Standard offers a clear, evidence based framework rooted in scientific findings and aligned with consumer expectations. It identifies products that avoid the core hallmarks of ultraprocessing, including both engineered additives and industrial processes that degrade food structure and function.** While some emerging policies focus narrowly on specific ingredients, ultra*processing* by definition demands that we evaluate *processing* itself. This standard does exactly that—recognizing that how a food is made is just as important as what goes into it. Grounded in current research, consumer interest, and real-world feasibility, it is designed to support innovation without compromising integrity, helping both manufacturers and consumers navigate a food system in urgent need of repair.

Rather than relying on a single definition, the standard approaches ultraprocessing through two essential dimensions:

1. **Ingredient Integrity & Formulation**  
   The standard restricts ingredients that are either widely recognized as harmful or characteristic of ultraprocessed formulations—especially those used to create hyperpalatable textures and flavors or replace the structure and function of real food. This includes a prohibition on non-nutritive sweeteners and limits on refined added sugar.

2. **Processing Limits**  
   Not all processing is equal. This standard distinguishes between minimal, conditional, and prohibited processing methods, requiring that products be composed primarily of minimally processed ingredients and free from high-impact chemical, structural, thermal and biological modification. These limits are applied both to individual ingredients and to the product as a whole.

Together, these two dimensions create a practical, rigorous, and achievable pathway for reshaping how food is made and marketed. By protecting what matters most—structural integrity, nourishment, and transparency—the Non-UPF Standard helps identify food that is real, nourishing, and designed with integrity.

1. # Introduction {#introduction}

The Non-UPF Standard is a practical tool for distinguishing non-ultraprocessed foods in a food system increasingly dominated by highly industrial processes and formulations. Rather than relying on vague health claims or subjective definitions, this standard provides clear, actionable criteria that evaluate foods based on processing methods and ingredient integrity.  
This document defines the scope of the standard, the classification of processing methods, and the methodology used to assess compliance. It establishes firm limits on industrial processing techniques, ensures ingredient transparency, and sets guardrails against hyperpalatable formulations that distort natural satiety signals. Additionally, it prohibits a range of concerning additives and synthetic ingredients that have been flagged by health experts and regulatory bodies worldwide, and that consumers increasingly identify as markers of ultraprocessing. In this way, the Standard reflects both the emerging science and consumer expectations.

By offering a structured framework, the Non-UPF Standard empowers brands, retailers, and consumers to align with food choices that prioritize ingredient integrity and reduced reliance on industrial processing techniques.

2. # Purpose {#purpose}

The Non-UPF Standard exists to provide a clear and enforceable framework for identifying foods that avoid excessive industrial processing and certain manufactured additives. It is designed to:

* Set measurable criteria for defining non-ultraprocessed foods based on processing methods, ingredient integrity, and formulation thresholds.  
* Eliminate harmful and unnecessary additives by prohibiting certain ingredients under investigation for metabolic dysfunction, gut microbiome disruption, and other health concerns.  
* Offer a practical, science-informed tool for food manufacturers, retailers, and consumers to navigate an increasingly complex food landscape.  
* Support innovation in food production that prioritizes whole, minimally processed ingredients while maintaining feasibility for real-world application.  
* Respond to consumer demand for trusted guidance in navigating a marketplace where ultraprocessed foods are both widespread and poorly understood.


This standard is not intended to evaluate nutrient content claims, overall nutrient adequacy, or dietary suitability; dictate dietary choices; or endorse any specific diet. Instead, it establishes firm guardrails that help preserve food integrity and reduce exposure to processing characteristics associated with adverse health outcomes.

3. # Scope {#scope}

The Non-UPF Standard applies to foods intended for human consumption and is designed to evaluate their processing methods, ingredient integrity, and formulation thresholds. 

This standard:

* Defines clear criteria for determining whether a food is non-ultraprocessed, based on how its ingredients are sourced, processed, and combined.  
* Classifies processing methods as permissible, conditional, or prohibited, ensuring food integrity is maintained.  
* Establishes ingredient restrictions, prohibiting additives and synthetic substances that compromise food quality and health.

This standard does not:

* Evaluate or endorse specific diets, eating patterns, or nutrient content claims.  
* Address the environmental, ethical, or economic aspects of food production.  
* Assess claims related to medical, functional, or performance benefits of foods.

By focusing on processing and ingredient compliance, the Non-UPF Standard serves as a foundational tool for improving transparency in the food supply while allowing for ongoing scientific and regulatory advancements. 

All criteria within this Standard are normative and mandatory. Compliance with the Standard requires adherence to all applicable requirements across ingredient integrity, processing methods, and whole-product formulation. Partial or selective compliance is not sufficient for verification.

This Standard shall be applied in good faith to uphold both its specific requirements and its overall intent. Reformulation or process changes undertaken for the purpose of meeting the requirements of this Standard are encouraged. However, reformulating products, altering manufacturing processes, or selecting novel ingredients with the primary intent of avoiding or circumventing these requirements or the spirit of this Standard is prohibited.

# 4 Terms and Definitions {#4-terms-and-definitions}

**added sugar** –  The portion of total sugars in a finished food that must be declared as “added sugars” under FDA nutrition labeling regulations, whether contributed by single-ingredient sweeteners or formed through the combination or concentration of ingredients during processing. Added sugars include free mono- and disaccharides, sugars from syrups and honey, and sugars from concentrated fruit or vegetable juices that provide more sugars than would be expected from the same volume of 100% juice of the same type. (Adapted from US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations on Nutrition Facts labeling [21 CFR §101.9](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-21/chapter-I/subchapter-B/part-101/subpart-A/section-101.9))

**adjusted weight percentage** – The proportion, expressed as a percentage, of the weight of a specific ingredient relative to the total weight of the final food, excluding added water and salt.

Note: The term “adjusted weight percentage” is defined for the purpose of this standard and is not used as formal terminology in U.S., Canadian, or Mexican food labeling regulations. It is intended to support consistent and transparent application of the standard’s processing eligibility criteria.

**food** – Any substance, whether processed, semi-processed, or raw, which is intended for human consumption, and includes beverages, as well as any substance used in the manufacture, preparation, or treatment of food. This definition does not include cosmetics, tobacco, or substances used only as drugs. (Adapted from Codex Alimentarius, FAO/WHO)

**biotransformed sweetener** –  A sweetener produced through enzymatic, microbial, or chemical transformation of carbohydrates, resulting in compounds that do not occur in meaningful quantities in whole foods and differ structurally from their source material.

**ingredient** – Any material or substance that is a component in the creation of a consumer good and present in said good in either its original or altered form.

**may** –  Permissible under the standard.

**minimally processed** – A food product that has undergone minimal alteration from its natural state, using simple mechanical or physical techniques that do not substantially change its original structure or composition. Such techniques include, but are not limited to, washing, cutting, peeling, drying, pasteurization, or freezing. 

**moderately processed** – A food product that has undergone processing techniques that involve some level of transformation while maintaining the fundamental characteristics of the food. These techniques include, but are not limited to, fermentation, baking, roasting, curing, dehydration, and smoking.

**non-nutritive sweetener** – A substance having less than 2% of the caloric value of sucrose per equivalent unit of sweetening capacity. ([21 CFR Section 170.3(o)(19) Definitions](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-21/chapter-I/subchapter-B/part-170/subpart-A/section-170.3))

**processing aid** – A substance used during the processing of a food for a technical or functional effect that is either removed, transformed, or present at insignificant levels in the final product and has no technical or functional effect in the finished food.

Note: This definition aligns with criteria described in [21 CFR §101.100(a)(3)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-21/chapter-I/subchapter-B/part-101/subpart-G/section-101.100) \[Food; exemptions from labeling\], which exempts substances from labeling if they are: (a) removed from the food before final packaging; (b) converted into constituents normally present in the food without significantly increasing those constituents; or (c) present at insignificant levels in the finished food and have no technical or functional effect in that food.

**shall/shall not** – A mandatory requirement under the standard.

**should/should not** – A non-mandatory recommendation under the standard.

**synthetic biology (precision fermentation)** – The development of novel, artificial nucleic acid sequences, biological pathways, organisms, or devices or the redesign of existing natural biological systems. 

Note: Adapted from The Non-GMO Project Standard Version 16.1 Appendix A \- Terms and Definitions: Synthetic Biology.

**total weight percentage** – The proportion, expressed as a percentage, of the weight of a specific ingredient relative to the total weight of the final food, including all ingredients, such as added water and salt.

Note: The term “total weight percentage” is defined for the purpose of this standard and is not used as formal terminology in U.S., Canadian, or Mexican food labeling regulations. It is intended to support consistent and transparent application of processing eligibility criteria.

**whole food** – A food that remains in or close to its natural state, meaning it has undergone minimal alteration from its original form. This includes retaining its natural composition, fiber, and essential nutrients without excessive separation, fractionation, recombination, extraction, isolation, purification, significant refinement, enzymatic modification, or artificial texturization. Whole foods are free from added synthetic ingredients, preservatives, and artificial substances, preserving their inherent structure and nutritional value.

## 6.2 Processing Requirements {#6.2-processing-requirements}

### 6.2.1 Processing Classification  {#6.2.1-processing-classification}

6.2.1.1 Food processing methods covered by this standard shall be classified as either Prohibited, Conditional, or Permissible. Detailed normative classifications and specific requirements are provided in Annex A.

6.2.1.2 Prohibited Methods shall not be used at any stage of the finished food product or ingredient production.

6.2.1.3 Conditional Methods may be used only if explicitly defined conditions specified within this standard are fully met.

6.2.1.4 Permissible Methods may be used without restriction within the conditions provided. These methods are further classified as:

6.2.1.4.a Minimal Processing, which preserves the food’s natural structure and integrity. 

6.2.1.4.b Moderate Processing, which alters the texture, flavor, or shelf life of food while   
maintaining its fundamental characteristics.

6.2.1.5 Notwithstanding the prohibitions outlined in this standard, any processing method that is demonstrably essential for ensuring food safety, mitigating potential health hazards or meeting mandatory regulatory requirements, shall be permitted. This exception is applicable only when no viable alternative method exists that can achieve equivalent food safety outcomes, and its use must not compromise the nutritional integrity or overall quality of the final food.

### 6.2.2 Criteria for Processing Applied to Ingredients {#6.2.2-criteria-for-processing-applied-to-ingredients}

6.2.2.1 For the purpose of determining ingredient-level processing requirements, adjusted weight percentage shall be used. 

6.2.2.2 Ingredient processing requirements apply only to ingredients declared on the product’s ingredient panel. Sub-ingredients or processing aids that are not required to appear on-pack under applicable labeling regulations are excluded from processing classification and assessment.

6.2.2.3 At least 70% of the food, calculated as the sum of the adjusted weight percentage of the ingredients, shall be minimally or moderately processed using permissible food processing methods.

6.2.2.4 The total proportion of conditionally processed ingredients shall not exceed 30% of the total weight.

### 6.2.3 Criteria for Processing Applied to Finished Products {#6.2.3-criteria-for-processing-applied-to-finished-products}

6.2.3.1 Only processing methods classified as permissible under this standard (as listed in Annex A) shall/may be applied to the combined ingredients during the transformation of ingredients into the finished good.

6.2.3.2 Regardless of food safety justification, no processing method classified as Conditional may be applied to more than 30% of the finished product formulation, calculated using adjusted weight percentage (excluding added water and added salt).

## 6.3 Formulation Requirements  {#6.3-formulation-requirements}

### 6.3.1 Prohibited Ingredients {#6.3.1-prohibited-ingredients}

6.3.1.1 To ensure comprehensive protection against ingredients inconsistent with the objectives of the Non‑UPF Verified program, this standard establishes a normative and authoritative list of prohibited ingredients: the Harmonized Prohibited Ingredients List (Annex B). This list comprises a selected collection of prohibited ingredients from quality standards and governmental regulations, including European Union regulations, PCC Community Markets, Whole Foods Market, and applicable U.S. state legislation.

6.3.1.2 Any substance listed on the product’s ingredient panel and explicitly banned by the list shall be prohibited, regardless of whether other sources or regulations allow their inclusion in food products.

### 6.3.2 Added Sugar Limits {#6.3.2-added-sugar-limits}

6.3.2.1 Products containing sweeteners that are the result of conditional processing per Annex A shall comply with the limits on added sugar specified in the Product Type and Added Sugar Limits table (Table 6-1).

**Table 6-1: Product Type and Added Sugar Limits** 

|  PRODUCT TYPE | Maximum Added sugar by Weight |
| :---- | :---- |
| Confectionery (candy, chocolate)  | 40% |
| Creamers (dairy and non-dairy) (serving size 2 tbsp or less) | 25% |
| Desserts (cookies, ice cream, bars, cakes, pastries, popsicles) | 20% |
| Breakfast Foods (cereal, granola, instant oatmeal, french toast, crêpes) | 15% |
| Dairy & Dairy Alternatives (yogurt, milk, cream cheese) | 7% |
| Breads, Tortillas, Buns, Bagels | 5% |
| Beverages (juice, coffee, tea, soda, kombucha) | 5% |
| Nut Butters & Spreads | 5% |
| Protein Powders (whey, pea protein, collagen) | 5% |
| Condiments (ketchup, dressing, mayonnaise) | 3% |
| Prepared Meals (frozen or shelf-stable) | 3% |
| Soups & Savory Sauces (tomato sauce, broth) | 2% |
| Snack Foods (chips, crackers, popcorn) | 2% |
| Meat & Plant-Based Protein (jerky, sausage, deli meat) | 2% |
| Baby & Toddler foods (any food marketed towards children younger than 4 years old) | 2% |
| Dry Mixes (baking mixes, dried soups, ready-to-mix beverages, etc.) | Variable; see section 6.3.2.7 |

6.3.2.2 Compliance shall be determined by calculating the percentage by weight of “added sugars” in the finished product, as defined in FDA nutrition labeling regulations. This is calculated as the grams of added sugars per serving (or per 100 g) divided by the total serving size (or 100 g), based on the Nutrition Facts panel. *Note: This contrasts with calculations requiring adjusted weight percentage elsewhere in this Standard.*

6.3.2.3 For the purposes of this standard, “added sugars” shall be determined in accordance with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations on Nutrition Facts labeling ([21 CFR §101.9](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-21/chapter-I/subchapter-B/part-101/subpart-A/section-101.9)). For products marketed in jurisdictions with stricter or more specific definitions, the stricter definition shall apply.

6.3.2.4 Products shall be assigned under the most relevant type listed in the Product Type and Added Sugar Limits table (Table 6-1). When a product does not clearly correspond to a single type, participants shall use their judgment and act in good faith to determine the most suitable type, documenting the rationale for the classification.

6.3.2.5  Calculations shall be performed on unrounded values prior to applying nutrition labeling rounding rules, except where compliance is clearly evident using Nutrition Facts values. When limits are low (5% or less) or results based on rounded values are close to the limit, unrounded data shall be used to confirm compliance.

6.3.2.6 Products that do not contain any sweeteners, and products that only contain sweeteners that are the result of Permissible Processing are not subject to the limits specified in Table 6-1, Product Type and Added Sugar Limits.

6.3.2.7 For Dry Mix products, the percentage of added sugar by weight shall be determined and classified based on the finished weight of the product as prepared, following the manufacturer’s directions for standard preparation. Dry Mix products shall comply with the added sugar limit applicable to their corresponding product type. 

### 6.3.3 Non-Nutritive and Biotransformed Sweeteners {#6.3.3-non-nutritive-and-biotransformed-sweeteners}

6.3.3.1 The use of non-nutritive sweeteners and biotransformed sweeteners, as defined in section 4 Terms and Definitions, is prohibited in all Non-UPF Verified products, except as allowed in section 6.3.3.4 below.

6.3.3.2 Many substances that meet these definitions, including, but not limited to, aspartame, acesulfame K, sucralose, saccharin, neotame, and steviol glycosides, are already listed in Annex B: Harmonized Prohibited Ingredient List, and are therefore banned from inclusion as ingredients per section 6.3.1 of the standard.

6.3.3.3 Beyond those explicitly named in Annex B, any sweetener that meets the definition of either a non-nutritive sweetener or a biotransformed  sweetener is prohibited from use at any level in a Non-UPF Verified product. This includes, but is not limited to, brazzein, thaumatin, monk fruit extract, sorbitol, xylitol and erythritol.

6.3.3.4 Whole-leaf or minimally processed *Stevia rebaudiana* preparations (dried leaf or crude aqueous extract) may be permitted in cases where the preparation is derived directly from plant leaves without isolation or purification of steviol glycosides, and its use is limited to flavor-level inclusion and not to replace caloric sweeteners.

### 6.3.4 Gums, Thickeners and Texturizers {#6.3.4-gums,-thickeners-and-texturizers}

#### 6.3.4.1. All gums, thickeners, and texturizers identified in Annex B are prohibited. This includes, but is not limited to, carrageenan, microcrystalline cellulose, polysorbates, polydextrose, and algal flour.

6.3.4.2. Gums, thickeners and texturizers produced through conditional processing methods, including, but not limited to, industrial fermentation and enzymatic hydrolysis processes, are prohibited ingredients in Verified products. This includes, but is not limited to, xanthan gum, gellan gum, maltodextrin and chemically modified cellulose derivatives (e.g., carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose).

6.3.4.3 Gums and other thickeners and texturizers obtained through mechanical or aqueous extraction from plant or seaweed sources may be used only when functionally necessary, specifically to suspend or stabilize added vitamins, minerals, or other essential nutrients in liquid products, or to provide structural binding in gluten-free or comparable formulations where no feasible minimally processed alternative exists. In such cases, this use shall be supported by documentation demonstrating both the functional necessity and the absence of viable, less processed alternatives.

Examples of ingredients potentially eligible for this allowance include guar gum, locust bean gum, tara gum, pectin, agar (agar-agar), and tamarind seed gum.

### 6.3.5 Natural Flavors {#6.3.5-natural-flavors}

**Note:**

The use of natural flavors represents a complex and often opaque area of food formulation. Because of this variability, and to avoid creating unnecessary barriers to participation or innovation, compliance with this section is optional for Version 1 of the Non-UPF Standard. Participants are still required to provide information related to natural flavor use to support data collection and inform the development of more specific and mandatory requirements in a future version of the Non-UPF Standard.

6.3.5.1 Natural flavors shall not be used to imply the presence of an ingredient that is absent or present only in trace amounts. Natural flavors shall only be used when a corresponding ingredient derived from the same food, issued from a permissible processing method, is also present in the product.

6.3.5.2 The weight of the corresponding ingredient (from a permissible processing method) must exceed that of the associated natural flavor in the finished product formulation.

6.3.5.3 Flavor names used on the product label, ingredient list, or marketing claims must reflect the inclusion of a corresponding ingredient in the product formulation.

6.3.5.4 Natural flavors that simulate or enhance the sensory profile of a specific food ingredient are prohibited when no corresponding ingredient from a permissible processing method is present in the formulation.

6.3.5.5 Natural flavors shall be used only in support of a clearly identifiable flavor profile linked to a corresponding ingredient. Use of natural flavors for purposes other than flavor contribution—including masking, enhancement, or sensory modification—is not permitted.

6.3.5.6 Natural flavors should not each exceed 0.5% of the product formulation, calculated using adjusted weight percentage.

6.3.5.7 Extracts are exempt from the natural flavor limitations of this standard when produced as traditional food or botanical preparations obtained solely through permissible methods such as maceration, percolation, distillation, or pressing. Eligible extracts must be derived exclusively from the named source material and may not contain any additional substances, including other flavor components, carriers, preservatives, or stabilizers. Extracts meeting these criteria must be declared on product labels by their common or usual name, identifying the source material.

### 6.3.6. Refined Oils {#6.3.6.-refined-oils}

6.3.6.1 Many refined or processed oils are listed in Annex B, Harmonized Prohibited Ingredients List, and are therefore prohibited for inclusion in Verified products in accordance with section 6.3.1, Prohibited Ingredients. This includes, but is not limited to, partially or fully hydrogenated oils, interesterified oils, solvent extracted oils, and brominated vegetable oil.

6.3.6.2 Oils that are the result of processing classified as conditional per Annex A (e.g., refined, bleached, and deodorized \[RBD\] oils) are subject to the requirements of Section 6.2.2 Criteria for Processing applied to Ingredients. 

6.3.6.3 Refined or conditionally processed oils as defined above shall not collectively comprise more than 30% of the finished product, calculated on an adjusted weight percentage basis.

### 6.3.7. Sodium {#6.3.7.-sodium}

6.3.7.1 Many sodium-contributing ingredients  are listed in Annex B, Harmonized Prohibited Ingredients List and are therefore prohibited for inclusion in Verified products in accordance with section 6.3.1, Prohibited Ingredients. This includes, but is not limited to, sodium-based preservatives, flavor enhancers, leavening agents, chelators, emulsifiers, and functional salts.

6.3.7.2 Naturally occurring sodium from unprocessed or minimally processed ingredients is permitted when used in accordance with applicable requirements of this Standard.
