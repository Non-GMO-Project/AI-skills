# Documentation Requirements for Non-UPF Verification

Source: Non-UPF Standard v1.0 (comprehensive) — for formal submission to the Non-GMO Project.

Use this to help users understand what they'll need to gather before formal submission. Prioritize based on the product's specific complexity.

## Always Required

**Product Identity**
- Product name (legal/official)
- Current product label — all panels, high resolution
- UPC/barcode
- Product description and intended use

**Formulation**
- Complete ingredient statement as it appears on label
- Full formulation with all sub-ingredients disclosed
- Ingredient weights in grams (or percentages)
- Total product weight
- Serving size

**Nutrition Facts**
- Current Nutrition Facts panel
- Unrounded added sugar values (if limit ≤5% or result is close to limit)

**Processing**
- Processing method for each ingredient (request from suppliers)
- Manufacturing process flow diagram
- Processing methods applied to finished product
- Temperature/time specifications for thermal processes

**Supplier Documentation**
For each significant ingredient:
- Ingredient specification sheet
- Certificate of Analysis (COA)
- Processing method description (confirm it matches your claims)
- Country of origin

## Required by Situation

**If any conditionally processed ingredients:**
- Supplier confirmation of specific processing method
- Calculated adjusted weight percentages
- Evidence thresholds are met (≥70% permissible, ≤30% conditional)

**If added sugar limits apply:**
- Nutrition Facts (with unrounded values if applicable)
- Product type classification rationale (especially if ambiguous)
- For dry mixes: standard preparation instructions and as-prepared nutrition facts

**If claiming gum/thickener conditional allowance:**
- Technical justification for functional necessity (vitamin suspension OR gluten-free binding)
- Documentation that no minimally processed alternative exists
- Supplier confirmation of mechanical or aqueous extraction method

**If a prohibited processing method was used for food safety:**
- Demonstration that the method is essential for food safety
- Evidence that no viable alternative exists
- Evidence that nutritional integrity is maintained

**If natural flavors are present:**
- Natural flavor specification sheets
- Identification of corresponding ingredient from permissible processing
- Weight comparison (ingredient weight must exceed flavor weight)

**If refined oils are present:**
- Oil refining process description
- Processing temperature confirmation
- Adjusted weight percentage calculation

## Document Naming Convention

Use a consistent naming convention for submission:
```
[CompanyName]_[ProductName]_[DocumentType]_[Version]_[YYYY-MM-DD]

Example:
AcmeFoods_OatmealRaisin_Formulation_v2_2025-01-13.pdf
```

## Freshness Standards

- Ingredient specifications: ideally <6 months old; >1 year requires supplier reconfirmation
- Certificates of Analysis: <1 year
- Labels: must reflect current product — not a draft

## Tips for Efficient Collection

1. Send a single comprehensive request to each supplier rather than multiple asks
2. Ask suppliers to confirm processing method in writing — "how was this ingredient made?" is often sufficient
3. Start collecting documentation in parallel with the ingredient/processing review, not after
4. For complex products, flag high-risk items first and confirm those suppliers before investing in full documentation
