## How to Use These Skills

### Method 1: With AI Chat Interfaces (Claude, ChatGPT, etc.)

1. **Start a new conversation** with your AI assistant

2. **Upload or paste the skill file** you want to use

3. **Provide your product information** as requested by the skill

4. **Follow the AI's guided prompts** as it works through the skill

5. **Review and document the outputs** generated by the AI

**Example:**
```
You: [Upload 01-product-eligibility-verification.md]
You: I need to verify if "Organic Strawberry Yogurt" is eligible for Non-UPF verification.

AI: I'll help you verify product eligibility for Non-UPF Standard v1.0. Let me gather the necessary information...
[AI follows the skill instructions to guide you through the process]
```

### Method 2: As Reference Documents

Use these skills as detailed reference guides while manually conducting verifications. The structured formats and checklists ensure nothing is missed.

### Method 3: With Custom AI Agents

If you build custom AI agents or integrations, these skills can serve as system prompts or workflow definitions for automated verification assistants.

## Recommended Workflow

### For New Product Verifications

**ALWAYS follow this sequence:**

```
START
  ↓
[01] Product Eligibility Verification
  ↓ [If ELIGIBLE]
[02] Processing Requirements Verification
  ↓ [If COMPLIANT]
[03] Formulation Requirements Verification
  ├─ [04] Prohibited Ingredients Checker (integrated)
  └─ [05] Added Sugar Calculator (if applicable)
  ↓ [If COMPLIANT]
[06] Documentation Collection
  ↓ [When COMPLETE]
[07] Evidence Validation
  ↓ [If VERIFIED]
[08] Master Checklist - Final Determination
  ↓
END - Verification Decision
```

### For Quick Checks

**Ingredient Check Only:**
- Use Skill 04 (Prohibited Ingredients Checker) standalone

**Added Sugar Check Only:**
- Use Skill 05 (Added Sugar Calculator) standalone

**Documentation Status:**
- Use Skill 06 (Documentation Collection) for tracking

## Best Practices

### 1. Use Skills Sequentially
Don't skip steps. Each skill builds on information from previous steps.

### 2. Document Everything
Save AI-generated reports and add them to your verification file.

### 3. Verify AI Calculations
Always double-check calculations, especially:
- Adjusted weight percentages
- Added sugar percentages
- Processing method classifications

### 4. Use Specialized Skills When Appropriate
If you only need to check ingredients quickly, use Skill 04 instead of running the full formulation verification (Skill 03).

### 5. Maintain Consistency
Use the same AI assistant and skills throughout a single product verification to maintain context and consistency.

### 6. Keep Skills Updated
As the Non-UPF Standard evolves, ensure you're using the most current version of these skills.

## Integration Tips

### For Technical Administrators

- **Create verification folders** for each product with sub-folders for each skill's outputs
- **Use the Master Checklist (Skill 08)** as your project management tool
- **Reference specific sections** from skills when communicating with manufacturers
- **Build a template library** from the output formats provided

### For Quality Assurance

- **Use Evidence Validation (Skill 07)** as your QA checklist
- **Verify all calculations** independently
- **Check cross-document consistency** as outlined in the skills
- **Review AI-generated determinations** before finalizing

### For Compliance Teams

- **Use skills as training materials** for new staff
- **Standardize reporting formats** using the provided templates
- **Track common issues** identified through skill use
- **Develop FAQ documents** based on skill guidance

## Troubleshooting

### AI Doesn't Follow the Skill Properly
- Ensure you've provided the complete skill file
- Give clear, specific information when prompted
- If AI deviates, redirect it back to the skill structure

### Missing Information
- Use the documentation collection skill (06) to identify gaps
- Request specific documents rather than general information
- Follow up systematically using provided templates

### Conflicting Results
- Re-verify calculations manually
- Cross-reference against the Non-UPF Standard document directly
- Use the Evidence Validation skill (07) to identify inconsistencies

### AI Can't Classify Something
- Reference Annex A directly for processing methods
- Escalate ambiguous cases per the Master Checklist guidance
- Document the issue for standard clarification

## File Naming Convention

When saving AI-generated reports:
```
[Company]_[Product]_[SkillNumber]_[SkillName]_[Date].pdf

Example:
AcmeFoods_OatmealRaisin_04_ProhibitedIngredients_2025-01-13.pdf
```

## Version Control

**Current Version:** 1.0 (Based on Non-UPF Standard v1.0, November 2025)

## Important Reminders

### These Skills Are Tools, Not Replacements

- **Professional judgment still required** - AI assists but doesn't replace human expertise
- **Verify all determinations** - Double-check AI calculations and classifications
- **Standard is authoritative** - When in doubt, refer to the Non-UPF Standard v1.0 directly
- **Good faith compliance** - Apply skills with integrity and proper intent

### Limitations

- AI may occasionally make errors in calculations
- Novel ingredients or processes may not be well-covered
- Standard interpretation may require expert consultation
- Evidence quality assessment requires human judgment

### Data Privacy

When using AI assistants:
- Be aware of confidential product information
- Use enterprise AI solutions if available
- Don't share trade secrets unnecessarily
- Follow your organization's data handling policies

## Quick Start Guide

**Never done a verification before?**

1. Start with the **Master Verification Checklist (Skill 08)**
2. It will guide you to use each specialized skill at the right time
3. Follow the phase-by-phase approach
4. Don't proceed to next phase until current phase is complete

**Experienced but want to streamline?**

1. Use specialized skills (01-07) for specific verification components
2. Integrate AI-generated reports into your existing workflow
3. Use output templates to standardize documentation

**Just need a quick check?**

1. Use **Skill 04** for ingredient checks
2. Use **Skill 05** for added sugar calculations
3. Use **Skill 01** for eligibility determinations

## Examples of Use

### Example 1: Full Product Verification

```
Session 1: Upload Skill 01, verify eligibility → ELIGIBLE
Session 2: Upload Skill 02, verify processing → COMPLIANT

Session 4: Upload Skill 06, collect documentation → COMPLETE
Session 5: Upload Skill 07, validate evidence → VERIFIED
Session 6: Upload Skill 08, final determination → APPROVED
```

### Example 2: Quick Ingredient Check
